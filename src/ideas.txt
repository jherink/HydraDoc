Stuff To Do
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Import CSS style sheets from a URL. - DONE
2)  Tables rows can be added to but they don't belong to a body. - DONE
3)  Clones should remove Element IDs - DONE
4)  Deep clone for TableRow doesn't seem to be working. - DONE
5)  Download and embed local URL sources from remote style sheet. -DONE
6)  Embed local URL sources from relative path style sheets - DONE

7)  Create unit test framework that allows for assertions between Stitchs/individual elements excluding IDs classes ect. as options. - SCRATCH THIS.  Users can do hash regressions removing ids.
8)  Give credit to ExCSS parser in a README if I have not done it - DONE
9)  Create interface for classes to implement when exporting from Stitch to other formats. - DONE (IExporter)
10) Create graphs for complex data representation. See Chart.js, canvas.js, amcharts, highcharts.  Do they also need to be exportable??? - DONE
11) Test different byte codes in HTML render? UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32. (See 12 as well)
12) Charset testing in both CSS rule set renders and HTML renders.
13) Alex proposed data imports? Ask more about this. He also mentioned data mapping??  
	This could work similar to Windows Report Viewer? Could this be done with XML transformations?
14) Change element ids to use a, b,...,aa, ab, ac,...,ba, bb instead of GUIDs for smaller html files. Like Google :) - DONE
15) Add factory methods that let user specify element ids. - SCRATCH THIS (Move away from ElementFactory, see 34)
16) Add factory methods that let automatically assign an id to an element. - SCRATCH THIS (Move away from ElementFactory, see 34)
17) Develop some way to parse out formatted elements like <i> and <b>. 
18) Add support for "style" - DONE
19) Add comments :<>
20) Test head class
21) Move CSS resources for Stitch out of CSS/Themes folder. - See 26 (DONE)
22) Make a Scatter plot & show average line.
23) Bar graphs use SVG instead of CSS. See 10. ( Use Google chart as reference https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery) 

24) Bar codes
25) Embedding PDF files - Pure HTML.
26) Themes - Currently there are w3-themes but they are hard to use - make them better. - DONE, does not apply to charts.
27) TimeSpan Axis & DateTime Axis.
28) Multiple paper sizes.
29) Page Margins - DONE (for left & right margins)

30) Document how to use Themes
31) Getting started documentation, Hello World sample.
32) Getting started documentation, charts
33) Getting started documentation, tables
34) Remove element factory -> Keep ID factory.
35) Parse HTML into a document... Important for mapping
36) Test all elements that have a DOMString for content are actually returning the DOMStrings children along with top level DOMString content -> They should be marked    as INodeQueryable to achieve this.  We need this for CSS styling and possible parsing.
37) Change PieChart from rendering it's labels if they will not fit into the slice.


----- EXPORT NOTES -----

For conversions from HTML to *x formats I think Open XML should be used. However,
CSS formatting should not be maintained.
